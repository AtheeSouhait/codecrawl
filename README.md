# ðŸ“’ Codecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any repository. Featuring advanced codebase indexing, semantic search, and data extraction capabilities.


## What is Codecrawl?

[Codecrawl](https://crawl.irere.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a repository URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data, generate embeddings then store them in a vector database. We currently support only public codebases accessible on different codehosts like GitHub and Gitlab and give you clean data for each.

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

### Indexing 

Used to index a repository using its URL and get repository file tree and content. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the indexing.

```bash
# the limits the number of files to index to a 100
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/index \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang",
      "limit": 100,
      "compress": false,
      "comments": false,
      "emptyLines": false,
      "scrapeOptions": {
        "formats": ["markdown", "xml", "plain"]
      }
    }'
```

Returns a indexing job id and the url to check the status of the index.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789",
  "url": "https://api.irere.dev/v1/index/123-456-789"
}
```

### Check Index Job

Used to check the status of a index job and get its result.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.irere.dev/v1/index/123-456-789 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "total": 36,
  "creditsUsed": 36,
  "expiresAt": "2024-00-00T00:00:00.000Z",
  "data": [
    {
      "markdown": "Codebase content in markdown format",
      "xml": "Codebase content in xml format",
      "plain": "Codebase content in plain text format",
      "metadata": {
        "topFiles": [
            {
                "chars": 3232, 
                "name":"src/components/landing.tsx",
                "tokens": 2123, 
                "percentage": 32
            }
        ],
        "repository": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang",
        "totalSize": 323232, // characters
        "totalTokens": 545464, // tokens
        "totalFiles": 123, // number of files
        "statusCode": 200
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scraping READMEs

Used to scrape information from README.md URL and get its content in the specified formats.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://github.com/Irere123/run-lang/blob/master/README.md",
      "formats" : ["markdown", "xml"]
    }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "markdown": "[Readme file content in markdown format]...",
    "xml": "[Readme file content in xml format]...",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Run Programming Language",
      "description": "[Experimental] Object-oriented, compiled, VM-based language designed for optimal performance and portability across different environments.",
      // other structured data extracted and formated using LLMs
    }
  }
}
```

### FileTree

Used to get the file tree of the whole repository using its URL. This returns markdown, plain, or html for the file tree of the repo

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/map \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang", 
      "formats: ["markdown", "plain"]
    }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
   {
     "markdown": "File structure in markdown....", // if specified as the return type
      "html": "File structure in html", // if specified as the return type
      "plain": "File structure in plain text", // if specified as the return type
      "data": {
        "tree": "[filetree]...",
        "repository": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang",
        "statusCode": 200
      }
   }
  ]
}
```

#### Map with search

Map with `search` param allows you to search for specific keyword inside a repository file structure.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/map \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang",
      "search": "docs"
    }'
```

Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "results": [
    "src/components/input.tsx",
    "src/components/main.tsx",
    "src/components/markdown.tsx",
  ]
}
```

### Batch Indexing Multiple URLs

You can now batch index multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /index endpoint works. It submits a batch indexing job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch index.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/batch/index \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "urls": ["https://github.com/irere123/run-lang", "https://github.com/irere123/relaunch"],
      "formats" : ["markdown", "xml"]
    }'
```

### Search

The search endpoint combines web search with Codecrawl's indexing capabilities to return full repository content for any query.

Include `indexOptions` with `formats: ["markdown"]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise it defaults to getting SERP results (repository, title, description).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/search \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
        "url": "http://github.com/Idee8/codecrawl",
        "query": "What is Codecrawl?"
    }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "repository": "https://github.com/Idee8/codecrawl",
      "title": "Codecrawl",
      "description": "Turn entire repository into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. Search, index and extract with a single API."
    }
  ]
}
```
